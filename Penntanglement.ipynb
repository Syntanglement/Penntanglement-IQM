Hovering the cursor over the circles and squares will reveal the specific corresponding values. By examining these values, one can determine the most optimal qubit mapping by finding a sequence of connecting qubits with high T2 times and low CZ gate errors. The transpile function has another parameter, optimization_level, which determines how much the transpiler should optimize the circuit. For this parameter, an integer value from 0-3 can be passed in as an argument (0 - no optimization, 1 - little optimization, 2 - moderate optimization, 3 - high optimization). "
